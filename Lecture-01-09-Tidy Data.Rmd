Quote from the book "R for Data Science", the author said

> R is an old
language, and some things that were useful 10 or 20 years ago now get in your
way. Itâ€™s difficult to change base R without breaking existing code, so most
innovation occurs in packages.
## What is tidyverse?

- base R's functions are often slow and the implementations are often not consistent
- writing code in `tidyverse` style usually is more elegant
- the operations would be easily chained together using piping (more below)

So what is tidyverse?

- It is a collection of R packages which are designed to be used together. 
  - `ggplot2`, for data visualisation
  - `dplyr`, for data manipulation
  - `tidyr`, for data tidying
  - `readr`, for data import
  - `purrr`, for functional programming
  - `tibble`, for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames
  - `stringr`, for strings
  - `forcats`, for factors

## dplyr basics

- It offers five basic verbs
  - `select`: picks variables based on their names
  - `filter`: picks cases based on their values
  - `mutate`: adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
  - `arrange`: changes the ordering of the rows
  - `summarize` or `summarise`: reduces multiple values down to a single summary

- These all combine naturally with `group_by` which allows you to perform any operation "by group". 


## Obtain some Data

First of all, we need some data to work with. If the data is stored in a `csv`,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights <- read_csv("flights.csv")
```

We are using the `tidyverse` function `read_csv` to import the `flights.csv` instead of the obsolete base function `read.csv`.
- `read_csv` imports data as `tibble` which has better output
- `read_csv` is often faster than `read.csv`
- `read_csv` handles unicode characters better


The datasets are actually obtained from the R package `nycflights13`

```{r}
# Airline on-time data for all flights departing NYC in 2013.
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
flights <- flights
```

## `select`: picks variables based on their names.

To select arrival and departure times,
```{r}
# old way to do it
# flights[, c("arr_time", "dep_time")]
select(flights, arr_time, dep_time)
```

### I don't see why it's useful

`dplyr` provides a lot of helper functions,

```{r}
# colon `:` specifies all the variables between the columns of `dep_time` and `arr_time`
select(flights, dep_time:arr_time)
# all the columns start with arr_
select(flights, starts_with("arr_"))
# all the columns end with _time
select(flights, ends_with("_time"))
# all the columns contain dep
select(flights, contains("dep"))
# all the columns do not contain dep
select(flights, -contains("dep"))
# using regular expression
select(flights, matches("^(arr|dep)_"))
# of course, we could select everything
select(flights, everything())
# move air_time to the front
select(flights, air_time, everything())
```

Remarks:
- if you just need a single variable, you could use `pull`.
- you could use `rename` to rename columns


## `filter`: picks cases based on their values

```{r}
filter(flights, origin == "JFK")
filter(flights, distance > 1000)
# note that we are using a single `&` instead of `&&` as in base R
filter(flights, origin == "JFK" & distance > 1000)
filter(flights, distance < 500 | distance > 1000)
filter(flights, !between(distance, 500, 1000))
# only keep the complete cases
filter(flights, complete.cases(flights))
```

## Chaining and piping

Very often, we will need to use multiple `dplyr` verbs, for example 
```{r}
filter(select(flights, origin, arr_time), origin == "JFK")
# the pipe operator %>% increases readability
flights %>%
  select(origin, air_time) %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>%
  filter(air_time < 500) %>%
  rename(airtime = air_time)
```

```{r}
# a few more examples
flights %>%
  select(origin, air_time) %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK", air_time < mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE))
mean_air_time <- flights %>%
  pull(air_time) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
flights %>%
  select(origin, air_time) %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK", air_time > mean_air_time)
# what if there is a name colision?
air_time <- flights %>%
  pull(air_time) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
flights %>%
  select(origin, air_time) %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK", air_time > {{ air_time }})
# you could use . to represent the working data frame
flights %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.))
```


In fact, this pipe operator is exported from the package `magrittr` and could be used solely
```{r}
x1 <- 1:5
x2 <- 2:6
sqrt(sum((x2 - x1)^2))
(x2 - x1)^2 %>%
  sum() %>%
  sqrt()
```

```{r}
# computer the binomial coefficients
n <- 5
x <- 0:5
choose(n, x)
n %>% choose(x)
x %>% choose(n, .)
list(n = 5, x = 0:5) %>% {
  choose(.$n, .$x)
}
```


PS: use `slice` if you want particular rows

```{r}
flights %>% slice(100:105)
```

## `mutate`: adds new variables that are functions of existing variables

```{r}
flights %>% mutate(
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
# we could refer to the columns just created
flights %>% mutate(
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  gain_per_hour = gain / (air_time / 60)
)
```


```{r}
# `transmute` only keep the new variables
flights %>% transmute(
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  gain_per_hour = gain / (air_time / 60)
)
```

### Six variations on ranking functions

- `row_number`: equivalent to `rank(ties.method = "first")`
- `min_rank`: equivalent to `rank(ties.method = "min")`
- `dense_rank`: like `min_rank()`, but with no gaps between ranks
- `percent_rank`: a number between 0 and 1 computed by rescaling min_rank to [0, 1]
- `cume_dist`: a cumulative distribution function. Proportion of all values less than or equal to the current rank.
- `ntile`: a rough rank, which breaks the input vector into n buckets

```{r}
some_data <- tibble(
  x = c(3, 4, 1, 3, 1)
)
some_data %>% mutate(row_number(), row_number(x), min_rank(x), percent_rank(x))
```

### `lead` and `lag`

```{r}
some_data2 <- tibble(
  time = 1:5,
  value = c(3, 4, 1, 3, 1)
)
some_data2 %>% mutate(diff1 = value - lag(value), diff2 = lead(value) - value)
```

### Conditional mutation

```{r}
flights %>% transmute(
  arr_delay = arr_delay,
  status = if_else(arr_delay > 0, "delayed", "on time")
)
(flight_distances <- flights %>%
  transmute(
    distance,
    distance_type = case_when(
      distance < 500 ~ "short",
      distance < 1000 ~ "mid",
      TRUE ~ "long"
    )
  ))
```

### `recode` values

```{r}
flight_distances %>% mutate(distance_type = recode(distance_type,
  long = "long-distance",
  mid = "mid-distance",
  short = "short-distance"
))
```

```{r}
some_data %>% mutate(
  y = recode(x,
    `1` = "one",
    `3` = "three",
    `4` = "four"
  )
)
```


## `arrange`: changes the ordering of the rows

```{r}
flights %>% arrange(year, month, day)
flights %>% arrange(desc(dep_delay))
```

## `summarize` and `group_by` operations


```{r} 
#3 simple ways to summarize the data
flights %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())

flights %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  tally() # shorthand

flights %>% count(tailnum) # another shorthand
```

```{r}
flights
# summarize with more information
flights %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    planes = n_distinct(tailnum),
    flights = n()
  )
# group multiple variables
(per_day <- flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(flights = n()))

(per_month <- per_day %>% 
  summarize(flights = sum(flights)))

(per_year <- per_month %>%
  summarize(flights = sum(flights)))
```


## Other useful functions

```{r}
flights %>% glimpse()
flights %>% sample_n(5)
## rows with smallest values of air_time with the original order preserved
flights %>% top_n(3, air_time)
```

## Some variations of verbs

`tidyverse` also ships with some variations of verbs which could be useful.

```{r}
# only select columns which are numerical
flights %>% select_if(is.numeric)
flights %>% select_if(~ is.numeric(.))
flights %>% select_if(~ !is.numeric(.))
flights %>% rename_if(is.numeric, ~ str_c("numeric_", .))

flights %>% mutate_if(
  ~ is.numeric(.) && is.double(.),
  round
)

flights %>% filter_if(
  ~ is.numeric(.),
  all_vars(. > 0)
)
```

```{r}
flights %>% rename_at(          
  vars(starts_with("arr_")),
  ~ str_replace(., "arr_", "arrival_")
)
flights %>% filter_at(
  vars(ends_with("_time"), -air_time),
  all_vars(. >= 1200)
)
```

## Two-table verbs

There are 4 types of joins.

- `inner_join(x, y)` only includes observations that match in both x and y
- `left_join(x, y)` includes all observations in x, regardless of whether they match or not. 
- `right_join(x, y)` equivalent to left_join(y, x)
- `full_join(x, y)` includes all observations from x and y

```{r}
(df1 <- tibble(id = c(1, 2), v = 2:1))
(df2 <- tibble(id = c(1, 3), a = 10, b = "a"))
```

```{r}
df1 %>% inner_join(df2)
df1 %>% left_join(df2)
df1 %>% right_join(df2)
df1 %>% full_join(df2)
```


## Tidy Data

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy

- Each variable must have its own column (long format).
- Each observation must have its own row (wide format).
- Each value must have its own cell.

Using the datasets from R for Data Science to show that the same data could be organised in different ways.



```{r}
# make sure you have tidyr 1.0
library(tidyr)
```

`pivot_longer` is the replacement for `gather()` and `pivot_wider()` is the replacement for `spread()`.
Both are designed to be simpler and can handle more cases than gather and spread.

### Privot longer

```{r}
relig_income %>%
  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = "income", values_to = "count")
```


```{r}
billboard %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"),
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "wk",
    names_ptypes = list(week = integer()),
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE,
  )
```

### Privot wider

```{r}
fish_encounters %>% pivot_wider(
  names_from = station,
  values_from = seen,
  values_fill = list(seen = 0)
)
```

```{r}
us_rent_income %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = c(estimate, moe))
```
