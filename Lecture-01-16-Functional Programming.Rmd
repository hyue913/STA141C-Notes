You'll learn some of the powerful programming tools provided by `purrr`, one of the tidyverse core packages.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


## What is functional programming?

> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
To put is simple, it is a programming style without side effects.

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  x$a <- 2
  x
}
x <- list(a = 1)
isTRUE(all.equal(f(x), x))
```

```{python}
def f(x):
  x["a"] = 2
  return x
x = {"a": 1}
f(x) == x
```

## Is R a functional language?

R, at its heart, is a functional programming language. Most base R functions are pure, with a few notable exceptions:

- `library()` which loads a package, and hence modifies the search path.

- `setwd()`, `Sys.setenv()`, `Sys.setlocale()` which change the working directory, environment variables, and the locale, respectively.

- `plot()` and friends which produce graphical output.

- `write()`, `write.csv()`, `saveRDS()`, etc. which save output to disk.

- `options()` and `par()` which modify global settings.

- `S4` related functions which modify global tables of classes and methods.

- Random number generators which produce different numbers each time you run them

Almost everything else in R are functions.
```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 2
x + y
`+`(x, y)

a <- 3:5
a[3]
`[`(a, 3)

z <- 1
`<-`(z, 1)

for (i in 1:10) print(i)
`for`(i, 1:10, print(i))
```

We could even change the body of previously defined functions
```{r}
add <- function(x, y) x + y
add(3, 1)
body(add) <- quote(x - y)
add(3, 1)
```

## Revisit for loops

Suppose we want to compute the sample medians for each column of the data frame

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
```

A naive way to do so
```{r}
median(df$a)
median(df$b)
median(df$c)
median(df$d)
```

```{r}
# a base R for loop
output <- vector("double", ncol(df))  # 1. output
for (i in seq_along(df)) {            # 2. sequence
  output[[i]] <- median(df[[i]])      # 3. body
}
output
```

Sometimes we would like to modify existing objects

```{r}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}
df$a <- rescale01(df$a)
df$b <- rescale01(df$b)
df$c <- rescale01(df$c)
df$d <- rescale01(df$d)
# or simply
for (i in seq_along(df)) {
  df[[i]] <- rescale01(df[[i]])
}
```

## For loops vs functionals

The pattern of looping over a vector, doing something to each element and saving the results is so common that the `purrr` package provides a function `map` to do it.

The basic syntax for `map` is
```
map(ITERATABLE, A_FUNCTION)
```
`ITERATABLE`'s are objects like vectors, list and data frame.

```{r}
map(df, median)
df %>% map(median)
```

```{r}
# the input is not necessary to be a data frame
map(c(9, 16, 25), sqrt)
```

```{r}
# pass additional arguments
map(df, mean, trim = 0.5)
```

```{r}
# preserve names
z <- list(x = 1:3, y = 4:5)
map(z, length)
```


The function `group_split` could be used to split a data frame into a list
```{r}
(models <- mtcars %>% 
  group_split(cyl) %>% 
  map(function(df) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = df)))
# or simply
(models <- mtcars %>% 
  group_split(cyl) %>% 
  map(~lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)))

```

## Type-specific map

`map()` always returns a list, even if all the elements have the same flavor and are of length one. But in that case, you might prefer a simpler object.

- `map_lgl()` makes a logical vector.
- `map_int()` makes an integer vector.
- `map_dbl()` makes a double vector.
- `map_chr()` makes a character vector.

```{r}
map_dbl(c(9, 16, 25), sqrt) # Unit map
 
```

## Name and position shortcuts

The `map_` functions provide some shortcuts to extract elements from lists or vectors.
```{r}
map_chr(list(LETTERS, letters), 2)
```

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_split(cyl) %>% 
  map(~lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_dbl("r.squared")

```

## Map more than one arguments

```{r}
a <- 1:5
b <- 1:5
map2_dbl(a, b, `^`)
# or equivalently
map2_dbl(a, b, ~ .x ^ .y)
```

## Enumerating over the input

```{r}
a <- c(11, 12, 13)
b <- c(1, 2, 3)
a %>% imap_dbl(~ .x + b[.y])
# equivalently
a %>% imap_dbl(function(v,i) v + b[i])
```


## Filtering

```{r}
a <- 11:20
m <- list(lowers = letters, uppers = LETTERS)

a %>% pluck(1)  # equivalent to a[1]
m %>% pluck("lowers")   # equivalent to m["lower"]
m %>% pluck("lowers", 2)  # equivalent to m["lower"][2]
```

### Keep and drop elements

```{r}
is_even <- function(x) x %% 2 == 0
a %>% keep(is_even)
# or equivalently
a %>% keep(~ . %% 2 == 0)

m %>% keep(~ "A" %in% .)
```

```{r}
a %>% keep(~!is_even(.))
a %>% keep(negate(is_even))
a %>% discard(is_even)
```

## Summerizing

```{r}
# is every element in a even?
a %>% every(is_even)

# are some elements in a even?
a %>% some(is_even)

a %>% has_element(2)  # 2 is a double
a %>% has_element(2L)

# the first even number is
a %>% detect(is_even)

# the first even number divisible by 7 is
a %>% detect(~ . %% 7 == 0)

# get the index of the first element  divisible by 7, then extract it
a %>% detect_index(~ . %% 7 == 0) %>% pluck(a, .)
```


## Modify elements selectively

```{r}
# a %>% modify(~ . + 1) results in an error because a is an integer vector
a %>% modify(~ . + 1L)

a %>% modify_if(is_even, ~ -.)
a %>% modify_if(~ !is_even(.), ~ -.)

a %>% modify_at(c(1, 3, 5), ~ 0L)
```


## Reshape lists

```{r}
m %>% flatten_chr()
```

```{r}
(m1 <- m %>% map(~ .[1:5]))
m1 %>% transpose()
```

## Add elements to lists

```{r}
li <- list(a = 1, b = 2)
li %>% 
  append(list(c = 3, d = 3)) %>%
  prepend(list(x = 0, y = 0)) %>%
  splice(u = 3, v = 4)
```

## Cross

The `map` function applies to the inputs elementwisely. Sometimes, we wish to consider all combinations of the inputs. The `cross*` functions are designed to handle those situations.

`cross2` usually is used together with `lift`
```{r}
a <- c(7, 8, 9)
b <- c(2, 3, 4)
cross2(a, b) %>% map(lift(choose))
```

```{r}
li <- list(a = c(7, 8, 9), 
           b = c(2, 3, 4))
li %>% 
  set_names(c("n", "k")) %>%
  cross() %>% 
  map(lift(choose))
```

```{r}
dat <- tibble(
  x = seq(-1, 1, length = 50),
  y = seq(-1, 1, length = 50))
# we wish to plot a heat map of sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

dat %>% 
  cross_df() %>% 
  mutate(z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, fill = z)) + geom_tile() 
```


## Reduce iteratable

The `reduce` function combines the values of a vector by iteratively applying a binary function.

```{r}
reduce(1:4, `+`)
# it means ((1 + 2) + 3) + 4

reduce(1:4, `+`, .dir = "backward")
# it means 1 + (2 + (3 + 4))

breduce(4:1, choose)
# it means choose(choose(choose(4, 3), 2), 1)
```

```{r}
# shortcircuit a reduction 
sum_until <- function(x, y) {
  if (x > 30) {
    done(x)
  } else {
    x + y
  }
}
reduce(1:10, sum_until)
```

`accumulate` works similarly but keep all the imediate calculations.

```{r}
accumulate(1:4, `+`)
```

```{r}
accumulate(1:10, sum_until)
```

# Nesting

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  nest(data = -cyl)
# or more readible
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(model = data %>% map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .))) %>%
  transmute(r_sq = model %>% map(summary) %>% map_dbl("r.squared"))
```
