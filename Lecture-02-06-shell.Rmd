A Shell is a program that enables user to interact with the operating system. There are a few common implementaion of a shell.

- bash
  - the most common shell
  - default in linux
  - used to be the default shell on macOS
- zsh
  - the default shell in macOS 10.15 Catalina
- powershell
  - primarily used in windows
  
We will focus on `bash` (and `zsh` is `bash` compatible).


There are a few program to launch the shell.

- linux
  - depends on the desktop environment, it could be gnome terminal, konsole etc..
- macOS
  - the default Terminal
  - iTerm2
- Windows
  - Powershell
  - Cmd (which runs DOS)
  - Cmder
- RStudio terminal
- Rmarkdown (for bash script)


## Commands to cover

### File navigation

- ls - list the current directory
  
  A usful alias for unix is
  ```
  alias ls='ls --color=auto -F'
  ```
  
- pwd - show the current directory
- cd  - change directory

  - `cd ..` go to parent directory
  - `cd -` go to the previous directory
  - `cd ~` go to the home directory


### File manipulation

- touch - create an empty file
- mkdir 
  - create a direpcty
  - `mkdir -p folder1/folder2/folder3`
- mv rename / move a file
- cp
- rm
  - `rm file`
  - `rm -r dir` 

### Utility

- echo
- cat 
  - print the content of a file
- which
- export


## SSH

> The SSH protocol (also referred to as Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another.
To use ssh, we need to install ssh.

- linux and macOS
  - you should have a the ssh program already
- Windows
  - if you have install git for windows, we should have git-bash and ssh installed.
  

### Login to your peloton account

```
ssh sta141c-NUMBER@peloton.cse.ucdavis.edu
```

Unfortunately, you will need to copy and paste password everytime you login. (I will teach you a way to do it in R without typing password each time).

  
### File editing over ssh


Editing a file over SSH is not an easy task. 

- use a text editor in the system
- edit it locally and upload it to the server
  - either use `scp` functions 
  - or a software, for example "Cyber Duck" for macOS and WinScp for Windows.

### `scp` function to copy files from to to server

To copy a local file `file.txt` to remote `~/foo/file.txt`
```
scp file.txt sta141c-98@peloton.cse.ucdavis.edu:~/foo/
```

To copy a local directory to remote `~/foo/local_directory`
```
scp -r local_directory sta141c-98@peloton.cse.ucdavis.edu:~/foo/
```

To copy a local file `file.txt` from remote `~/foo/file.txt`
```
scp sta141c-98@peloton.cse.ucdavis.edu:~/foo/file.txt ./
```

To copy a directory from remote `~/foo/`
```
scp -r sta141c-98@peloton.cse.ucdavis.edu:~/foo/ ./
```


### The package `ssh` and `keyring`.

```{r}
library(keyring)
# only need to do it once
key_set("PELOTONPASSWORD")
```

```{r}
library(ssh)
session <- ssh_connect(
  "sta141c-98@peloton.cse.ucdavis.edu", 
  passwd = keyring::key_get("PELOTONPASSWORD"))
session
```
```{r}
session %>% ssh_exec_wait(
  "ls -A"
)
```


```{r}
session %>% ssh_exec_wait("mkdir -p shell")
session %>% scp_upload("shell.Rmd", to = "shell/")
session %>% scp_download("shell/shell.Rmd", to = "foo/")
```

```{r}
ssh_disconnect(session)
```
